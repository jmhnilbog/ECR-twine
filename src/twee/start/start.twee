Every system contains theorems that may not be proven within that system.

Every dimension is expressible as a real number 0 to 1 inclusive, as it exists as a measurable quantity.

The ULTIMATE CATALOG is a system that enumerates all countably infinite possible narratives.

Those narratives that may not be indexed by the ULTIMATE CATALOG compose NULLSPACE. Observation of NULLSPACE from a countably infinite dimensional remove reveals
ETERNAL COMPASS ROSE

Each countably infinite dimension is a measurable quantity expressible as a real number [0â€¦1].
The ultimate catalog 

 

Every simulation contains references to all simulations.
There is no FIRST CAUSE.
Story is the conversion of simulated NULLSPACE into narrative.
NULLSPACE asymptotically approaches zero in countably infinite dimensions.
The asymptote may only be
ETERNAL COMPASS ROSE
