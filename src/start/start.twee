Every system contains theorems that may not be proven within that system.

Every dimension is expressible as a real number 0 to 1 inclusive, as it exists as a measurable quantity.

The ULTIMATE CATALOG is a system that enumerates all countably infinite possible narratives.

Those narratives that may not be indexed by the ULTIMATE CATALOG compose NULLSPACE. Observation of NULLSPACE from a countably infinite dimensional remove reveals

Each countably infinite dimension is a measurable quantity expressible as a real number [0â€¦1].

Every simulation contains references to all simulations.
There is no FIRST CAUSE.
Story is the conversion of simulated NULLSPACE into narrative.
NULLSPACE asymptotically approaches zero in countably infinite dimensions.
